= Description
  Native IO for Windows. This class matches and extends the current Ruby
  IO class API, using native Windows functions underneath the hood.

= Installation
  gem install win32-nio

= Synopsis
  require 'win32/nio'
  include Win32
   
  # Similar to Ruby
  p NIO.read('some_file.text')
  p NIO.read('some_file.text', 50)
  p NIO.read('some_file.text', 50, 5)

  p NIO.readlines('some_file.txt')
  p NIO.readlines('some_file.txt', '')

  # With events
  event = Win32::Event.new

  NIO.read('some_big_file.txt', nil, nil, event)
  p event.signaled? # => true

  # With blocks
  NIO.read('some_big_file.txt'){ puts "Finished" }

= Proof of Concept 
  This code was originally written to see if using pure Windows functions
  to implement MRI methods would offer any practical advantage. The answer
  is a definite maybe.

  Functionally, these library does offer something the MRI methods do not,
  which is the ability to provide a block or event object that is called
  when a read is finished.

  In terms of speed, I've found the NIO.read method to be almost twice as
  fast as Ruby 2.2, while the NIO.readlines method was about the same speed.
  In most cases the NIO.readlines method offers no practical advantage, but
  see the documentation for details.
   
= Benchmarks

  Using my current laptop running Windows 7 I saw these results, which were
  typical in repeated runs:

  IO.read(small)         0.000000   0.016000   0.016000 (  0.020342)
  NIO.read(small)        0.000000   0.000000   0.000000 (  0.008140)
  IO.read(medium)        0.187000   0.047000   0.234000 (  0.230579)
  NIO.read(medium)       0.015000   0.093000   0.108000 (  0.122542)
  IO.read(large)         1.654000   0.593000   2.247000 (  2.355478)
  NIO.read(large)        0.343000   0.765000   1.108000 (  1.222567)
  IO.readlines(small)    0.125000   0.000000   0.125000 (  0.119982)
  NIO.readlines(small)   0.094000   0.015000   0.109000 (  0.132461)
  IO.readlines(medium)   1.419000   0.234000   1.653000 (  1.764216)
  NIO.readlines(medium)  1.092000   0.109000   1.201000 (  1.537593)
  IO.readlines(large)   12.714000   0.874000  13.588000 ( 13.798494)
  NIO.readlines(large)   9.719000   0.468000  10.187000 ( 13.437217)
  
  Your results may vary.

= JRuby
  As of version 0.2.0 this code was written as a C extension, and
  does not support JRuby. However, JRuby users can continue to use
  the 0.1.x branch.
